# aws-name-asg-instances

Automatically apply Name tags to instances in an ASG based on their custom
tags.

Names that appear in the AWS console beside EC2 instances are set by
creating a special tag `Name`.  When members of an ASG start, they are not
given any names, so often what happens is that instance is allowed to
name itself inside of user data.  However, if user data fails for any
reason, the instance will never name itself and it can be difficult to
find the instance's purpose in the AWS console.

The issue with an instance naming itself is that the instance profile (and
underlying IAM role) provides the instance with the `ec2:CreateTags`
permission, which cannot have a scoped `Resource` declaration.  This
violates least privilege and provides the instance with the ability to
create (and overwrite) tags on any instance in the same AWS account.

This project creates a CloudWatch Event rule that watches for AutoScaling
events, specifically the successful launch of new EC2 instances, and names
them based on their tags.  Thus, only the Lambda function that backs the
CloudWatch Event rule has the abiility to name EC2 instances, and only in
a specific format.

## Costs

The resources created under this CloudFormation template will cost either
very little or nothing.  The only element that costs anything is the
Lambda function, and Amazon has a generous free tier that should cover
just about everyone's use case for this tool, making it free to run.

## Naming Format

The instances are named based on the following convention:

```
<project>-<environment>-<instance_id>
```

The tags `project` and `environment` must be available on the instance and
given a non-empty string value.  The `instance_id` is already known by the
auto-scaling group during launch, so you do not need to provide it.

The `instance_id` is stripped of its `i-` prefix, leaving only the unique
ID.

The resulting name is then limited to 255 characters, as that is the
limit of tag values.

An example of this is, using a project `donny` and environment `staging`
is:

```
donny-staging-029d0202d1a
```

## Project Requirements

* Ansible (optional, but useful)
* Amazon Web Services account
* Permissions to create AWS resources:

  Specifically: CloudFormation, CloudWatch Events, Lambda, IAM roles

## Launching the Stack

The stack must be launched in any region where auto-scaling groups are
used and you want to name its members.  However, CloudWatch Event rules
may not be available in every region, so the following Ansible playbook
ensures that the stack is launched only in the regions where all AWS
services are supported.

```
ansible-playbook -i localhost.inventory -e 'stack_env=production' create-stack.yml
```
